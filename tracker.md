I'm experimenting with a hyper simple lifestyle tracking system. The idea is simple, I log activities I deem positive or negative to some aspect of my life with a simple binary input; thumbs up/down, swipe left/right etc. I can then decide what ratio of positive to negative ticks strikes the right balance. 

To test whether or not I will actually utilize such a tool I've mocked something up using Google's Suite of tools. I'll try using this for the next month and access whether or not it's working for me. 

### Submission Form

As you can see I've added some additional **optional** parameters that will provide a bit more incite into my patterns.  

### Tracking 
I've created a couple of dynamic charst using Google Sheets and embedded them below. 

##### Weekly Stats
I'm not sure how to implement this with Gdocs yet but some kind of quick overview would be handy. 

<div class="ticker">
	<div class="rounded-box bg-red text-center">
		<p class="jumbo">-2</p>
		<p class="title">This Week</p>
	</div>
	<div class="rounded-box bg-green text-center">
		<p class="jumbo">5</p>
		<p class="title">Last Week</p>
	</div>
	<div class="rounded-box bg-orange text-center">
		<p class="jumbo">2</p>
		<p class="title">Average</p>
	</div>
</div>

##### Week by Week Progress
A summary of the total amount of Positive and Negative pings each week. This will be helpful in tracking my week to week progress.

##### Total Positive & Negative Pings To Date
This will allow me to track my overall progress since starting to use the tool. Red is negative and Green is positive.
