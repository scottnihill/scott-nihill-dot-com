I'm not exactly sure what motivated me this year to create christmas paper with phalic pine cones. Wrapping paper is usually the last thing on my mind until the very last minute, usually the night before Christmas, or the morning of! 

About a month ago my sister was cleaning out her storage space where I had put 5 boxes of comic books and a bunch of shipping materials, including a giant roll of packing paper. Closet space is at a minimum at home so storing the giant roll of paper wasn't an option. So it was either give the roll away or find something to do with it. I don't have any experience with block printing or carving, nonetheless, I decided to create my own christmas themed wrapping paper. If I was going to go as far as carve my own block print I figured the concept had to be worth it, no ordinary or typical imagery would do. The print had to be something that you couldn't get anywhere else. In researching seasonal objects I came across a phalic looking pine cone and figured it would become my muse.
