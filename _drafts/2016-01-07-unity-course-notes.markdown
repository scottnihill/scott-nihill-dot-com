It's about time that I learn Unity3D development so I've tracked down a course at Udemy titled; <a href="https://www.udemy.com/unitycourse/learn/v4/overview" target="_blank">Learn to Code by Making Games</a>. 

Some of the software that I'll be using is; 

* Unity3D & C#
* 3D Modelling Software
* Audacity
* Gimp
